              <p>
                My name is Doan Huy, my student number is s3924345. I’m Vietnamese, 18 years old and I’m in the 1st semester at RMIT. I have a number of hobbies and I believe my hobbies would help me a lot in my life, such as listening to music, playing musical instruments help me to connect with people who have interest in music, playing sports such as football, basketball help me to stay healthy, expand my network by playing with different people as a team. Otherwise, esports is another hobby to help me entertain, connect with more friends and strengthen our relationship based on teamwork and collaborative games, such as League of Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty, all of which attracts millions of players around the world. When it comes to my IT interest, I am interested in different IT projects, but what I like most about IT are the Internet of things (IoT) and AI. I have been interested in IOT and AI since I was a child, by watching science fiction movies, where characters control different devices such as lights, cars by voice, gestures, ... and smart robots that support humanity in different aspects. When I grew up, I have seen different realistic applications of IOT and AI in real life, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Google assistant, Tesla self-driving car… Moreover, IoT demand is growing rapidly, when different companies invest in IoT and AI in their products like Google, Bosch+, LG, Samsung and other tech companies invest and develop their products for IoT compatibility. As a result, I believe that in the future, I will have a high opportunity to develop my career path as an IoT developer, earn a fortune by doing what I love in this field.  Regarding IT experiences, I’m a freshman in IT, so I have not had any experience in IT, so I will make an effort, work hard and always be willing to learn to improve my knowledge and skills that are required in this industry. I hope in the future, I will catch up with the innovation of IoT and become successful in this field.

              <h2>S3926557</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Tran Anh Son and my RMIT Student ID is s3926557. I was born and raised in the capital city of Vietnam – the city of Hanoi. Right now, I am living with 4 other members of my family (my parents and two sisters) in the city suburbs. After 12 years of education in schools as a good student, I have learnt a lot about Math and natural sciences in general as they are my favorite subjects. Furthermore, I am also a very good English learner as I have achieved an IELTS Certificate of 7.0 recently and other smaller prizes for excellent students of the city for English. My friends often say that I am smart and perceptive, but I just think they overestimate me because I am just eager to learn new things, no matter what the topics. Like many other young Vietnamese, I like playing sports, especially football, and listening to music. Apart from that, I also play online video games when I have spare time and truth be told, I am pretty good at these games. However, my real passion is for information technology and computers. I remember when I was just a small child, my uncle used to have an Internet café and he taught me so many things about computers and technology. That is when I realized how much I love computer parts and the programs that are running inside them. Since then, I have always had a dream of being a video game developer working for a big technology corporation. Lastly, I am the kind of person who wants everything I do to be the best, so I always push myself harder and harder in order to achieve that preference.

              <p>
                My name is Nguyen Thi Phuong Anh and my student number is s3926553. I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi – capital city of Vietnam. At the present, I can communicate in two languages: Vietnamese, which is my native tongue, and English, which I have studied since I was five years old. I am now a freshman at RMIT University in Hanoi, majoring in Information Technology. In terms of my pastime, I am passionate about traveling and discovering new locations, cultures, and societies. Aside from that, I am a huge enthusiast of technological gear, which is why I am enrolled in RMIT's IT program. In more detail about IT life, I’m keen on finding out about new technical devices released and playing games. I kind of like tinkering with electrical devices like once I could easily set touch ID for my mom’s smartphone while I had never had experience with using this device before. Generally, that was the beginning of my interest in technology, then I started embarking on researching, learning some basic Python code at the age of 14, watching related YouTube videos and practicing exercises by myself. A little bit growing up, I was more involved in the gaming industry. After experiencing almost all types of game, especially the adventure genre and watching games streaming, I realized that the game world was pretty interesting and I was motivated to also be able to create such an attractive video game in the future. Therefore, I gradually oriented myself to become a game developer.

                I’m Tran Duy Hung, s3928533 is my student number. I come from Vietnam and now I’m a freshman at RMIT University. I have a huge passion for music, especially Rap & HipHop. Since I was small, I have always wondered whenever I play a game that how can the characters move or fight, or how the websites were so detailed. Then I started to find out what IT is. After doing some research about it, I have realized that this is actually a world of power, a world in which I can do anything I want. I have tried sometimes to make a website but that was when I was too young and didn’t have enough knowledge. RMIT is an international university, where I can gain exposure to new knowledge sooner than IT students in other national universities. Moreover, at RMIT, I will have opportunities to balance daily life and student life when all subjects are about our major. I can study, and participate in activities such as clubs, … During my study, I want to learn all about coding and a little bit of graphic design so that I can create games as I want. Games Developing is where ITers can feel free to create their own stories, their own characters, etc.

              <h2>S3925921</h2>
              <p>
                I’m Nguyen Dinh Khai and my student number is s3925921. I was born and raised in Hanoi city in Vietnam. People might say I have a wide range of hobbies such as music, movies and clothing or just fashion in general. I often found myself researching old collections of various fashion houses/brands or just surfing through countless categories of clothes from vintage stores or second-hand clothing boutiques. Aside from that, I consider myself to be a big cinephile, I often spend time finding little known movies, lurking around forums, websites to learn more about art house movies from around the world and I am also keeping track of different movies festivals. I have always been fascinated about the technology world and wondering how an application works since I was kid. Recent years, I discovered the coding side of the industry and have treated it as an art form rather than a science subject. I guess that has sparked my interest in IT and I decided to join RMIT university to equip myself with fundamental knowledge about programming languages, data structures, algorithms, etc, to be a software engineer. Right now, I'm in my first semester at RMIT and have learned about Python with a little of front-end web programming with HTML and CSS and I’m hoping to extend my computing knowledge during my time at RMIT.

                  <p>Our group has been working for more than a month together since the beginning of assignment 2, and our group can have collaborated with each other effectively overall. Firstly, our team split the work with each other reasonably, different people in our team shared equal workload so no one in our team felt stressed or unequal with the other members. Secondly, the team members have close friendship with each other, so it is not a burden when our group has to work with each other and we could easily share with each other problems and help each other with difficulties we face, as well as giving feedback for other members. 
                    If there is anything that requires modification, each member in the group should divide the time reasonably and efficiently to complete each task because the time we tend to use is often more than we expect. The deadline for each tasks should be setted carefully so the team members would be more discipline in our tasks.

          <div class="career-bottom">
            <p>Our group, with five members, can be deemed to be the largest in this initiative. We can deploy the task more easily and receive more support from our teammates because our group has a bigger number of members than other groups. Huy, our leader, is perhaps the most active member of the group. Huy has a lot of great ideas, however there are some that can't be done right now due to constraints. With a creative mind and a positive attitude at work, becoming an artificial intelligence engineer would be a good fit for Huy, because artificial intelligence might be able to perform more exciting things in the future owing to this leader. Then there's Son, who has a highly logical mind and is constantly thinking about how to fix the current difficulty as well as potential future problems with the project. With that level of work discipline and completion, Son has every incentive to pursue a career as a software programmer. With her diligence, resourcefulness in unforeseen situations, and passion for color, Phuong Anh, the lone lady in the group, is certain that game development is the appropriate decision. Hung is the next member, who is always decisive, understands the feelings of the members as well as those around them when dealing with them, and has excellent communication skills. Hung also has professional creativity, thus his chosen job is Android app programming. Finally, there's Khai, a brother who is always quiet but stands out for his ability to create code that is very classy in comparison to his colleagues, as well as a very high degree of competence, and he selected DevOps Engineer as his career. However, each person's work has very specific criteria in terms of both qualifications and academics. However, practically every position requires basic criteria, such as a bachelor's degree in Information Technology or related areas, exposure and work experience for a specific amount of time, or a good command of the English language in order to communicate with foreign partners.... Of course, there will be commonalities, but there will also have to be variations in the process of group members attaining their goals. 6 months of experience is required for AI (Huy), C/C++ (Son), and game developers (Phuong Anh), whereas DevOps (Khai), and android developers (Hung) require greater experience, ranging from 2-3 years. Furthermore, Huy, Son, Hung, and Phuong Anh's positions require them to speak with consumers directly when necessary, although Khai's employment simply requires him to deal with computers. Huy's work will be focused on machine learning and deep learning, whereas Phuong Anh's game programming and Son and Hung's software programming will involve a lot of code and some design. Khai's employment entails a more analytical approach to data arrays. Everyone is on their own road, but they are all working toward the same goal, so the group continues to rally around one another. We are stepping into the future one step at a time by promoting each other's talents and limiting one other's weaknesses, thereby contributing to the overall success of the team.</p>
