              <p>
                My name is Doan Huy, my student number is s3924345. I’m Vietnamese, 18 years old and I’m in the 1st semester at RMIT. I have a number of hobbies and I believe my hobbies would help me a lot in my life, such as listening to music, playing musical instruments help me to connect with people who have interest in music, playing sports such as football, basketball help me to stay healthy, expand my network by playing with different people as a team. Otherwise, esports is another hobby to help me entertain, connect with more friends and strengthen our relationship based on teamwork and collaborative games, such as League of Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty, all of which attracts millions of players around the world. When it comes to my IT interest, I am interested in different IT projects, but what I like most about IT are the Internet of things (IoT) and AI. I have been interested in IOT and AI since I was a child, by watching science fiction movies, where characters control different devices such as lights, cars by voice, gestures, ... and smart robots that support humanity in different aspects. When I grew up, I have seen different realistic applications of IOT and AI in real life, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Google assistant, Tesla self-driving car… Moreover, IoT demand is growing rapidly, when different companies invest in IoT and AI in their products like Google, Bosch+, LG, Samsung and other tech companies invest and develop their products for IoT compatibility. As a result, I believe that in the future, I will have a high opportunity to develop my career path as an IoT developer, earn a fortune by doing what I love in this field.  Regarding IT experiences, I’m a freshman in IT, so I have not had any experience in IT, so I will make an effort, work hard and always be willing to learn to improve my knowledge and skills that are required in this industry. I hope in the future, I will catch up with the innovation of IoT and become successful in this field.

              <p>
                My name is Tran Anh Son and my RMIT Student ID is s3926557. I was born and raised in the capital city of Vietnam – the city of Hanoi. Right now, I am living with 4 other members of my family (my parents and two sisters) in the city suburbs. After 12 years of education in schools as a good student, I have learnt a lot about Math and natural sciences in general as they are my favorite subjects. Furthermore, I am also a very good English learner as I have achieved an IELTS Certificate of 7.0 recently and other smaller prizes for excellent students of the city for English. My friends often say that I am smart and perceptive, but I just think they overestimate me because I am just eager to learn new things, no matter what the topics. Like many other young Vietnamese, I like playing sports, especially football, and listening to music. Apart from that, I also play online video games when I have spare time and truth be told, I am pretty good at these games. However, my real passion is for information technology and computers. I remember when I was just a small child, my uncle used to have an Internet café and he taught me so many things about computers and technology. That is when I realized how much I love computer parts and the programs that are running inside them. Since then, I have always had a dream of being a video game developer working for a big technology corporation. Lastly, I am the kind of person who wants everything I do to be the best, so I always push myself harder and harder in order to achieve that preference.

                My name is Nguyen Thi Phuong Anh and my student number is s3926553. I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi – capital city of Vietnam. At the present, I can communicate in two languages: Vietnamese, which is my native tongue, and English, which I have studied since I was five years old. I am now a freshman at RMIT University in Hanoi, majoring in Information Technology. In terms of my pastime, I am passionate about traveling and discovering new locations, cultures, and societies. Aside from that, I am a huge enthusiast of technological gear, which is why I am enrolled in RMIT's IT program. In more detail about IT life, I’m keen on finding out about new technical devices released and playing games. I kind of like tinkering with electrical devices like once I could easily set touch ID for my mom’s smartphone while I had never had experience with using this device before. Generally, that was the beginning of my interest in technology, then I started embarking on researching, learning some basic Python code at the age of 14, watching related YouTube videos and practicing exercises by myself. A little bit growing up, I was more involved in the gaming industry. After experiencing almost all types of game, especially the adventure genre and watching games streaming, I realized that the game world was pretty interesting and I was motivated to also be able to create such an attractive video game in the future. Therefore, I gradually oriented myself to become a game developer.

Since I was small, I have always wondered whenever I play a game that how can the characters move or fight, or how the websites were so detailed. Then I started to find out what IT is. After doing some research about it, I have realized that this is actually a world of power, a world in which I can do anything I want. I have tried sometimes to make a website but that was when I was too young and didn’t have enough knowledge. RMIT is an international university, where I can gain exposure to new knowledge sooner than IT students in other national universities. Moreover, at RMIT, I will have opportunities to balance daily life and student life when all subjects are about our major. I can study, and participate in activities such as clubs, … During my study, I want to learn all about coding and a little bit of graphic design so that I can create games as I want. Games Developing is where ITers can feel free to create their own stories, their own characters, etc.

                I’m Nguyen Dinh Khai and my student number is s3925921. I was born and raised in Hanoi city in Vietnam. People might say I have a wide range of hobbies such as music, movies and clothing or just fashion in general. I often found myself researching old collections of various fashion houses/brands or just surfing through countless categories of clothes from vintage stores or second-hand clothing boutiques. Aside from that, I consider myself to be a big cinephile, I often spend time finding little known movies, lurking around forums, websites to learn more about art house movies from around the world and I am also keeping track of different movies festivals. I have always been fascinated about the technology world and wondering how an application works since I was kid. Recent years, I discovered the coding side of the industry and have treated it as an art form rather than a science subject. I guess that has sparked my interest in IT and I decided to join RMIT university to equip myself with fundamental knowledge about programming languages, data structures, algorithms, etc, to be a software engineer. Right now, I'm in my first semester at RMIT and have learned about Python with a little of front-end web programming with HTML and CSS and I’m hoping to extend my computing knowledge during my time at RMIT.

                  <p>Our group has been working for more than a month together since the beginning of assignment 2, and our group can have collaborated with each other effectively overall. Firstly, our team split the work with each other reasonably, different people in our team shared equal workload so no one in our team felt stressed or unequal with the other members. Secondly, the team members have close friendship with each other, so it is not a burden when our group has to work with each other and we could easily share with each other problems and help each other with difficulties we face, as well as giving feedback for other members. 
                    If there is anything that requires modification, each member in the group should divide the time reasonably and efficiently to complete each task because the time we tend to use is often more than we expect. The deadline for each tasks should be setted carefully so the team members would be more discipline in our tasks.

          <div class="career-bottom">
            <p>Our group, with five members, can be deemed to be the largest in this initiative. We can deploy the task more easily and receive more support from our teammates because our group has a bigger number of members than other groups. Huy, our leader, is perhaps the most active member of the group. Huy has a lot of great ideas, however there are some that can't be done right now due to constraints. With a creative mind and a positive attitude at work, becoming an artificial intelligence engineer would be a good fit for Huy, because artificial intelligence might be able to perform more exciting things in the future owing to this leader. Then there's Son, who has a highly logical mind and is constantly thinking about how to fix the current difficulty as well as potential future problems with the project. With that level of work discipline and completion, Son has every incentive to pursue a career as a software programmer. With her diligence, resourcefulness in unforeseen situations, and passion for color, Phuong Anh, the lone lady in the group, is certain that game development is the appropriate decision. Hung is the next member, who is always decisive, understands the feelings of the members as well as those around them when dealing with them, and has excellent communication skills. Hung also has professional creativity, thus his chosen job is Android app programming. Finally, there's Khai, a brother who is always quiet but stands out for his ability to create code that is very classy in comparison to his colleagues, as well as a very high degree of competence, and he selected DevOps Engineer as his career. However, each person's work has very specific criteria in terms of both qualifications and academics. However, practically every position requires basic criteria, such as a bachelor's degree in Information Technology or related areas, exposure and work experience for a specific amount of time, or a good command of the English language in order to communicate with foreign partners.... Of course, there will be commonalities, but there will also have to be variations in the process of group members attaining their goals. 6 months of experience is required for AI (Huy), C/C++ (Son), and game developers (Phuong Anh), whereas DevOps (Khai), and android developers (Hung) require greater experience, ranging from 2-3 years. Furthermore, Huy, Son, Hung, and Phuong Anh's positions require them to speak with consumers directly when necessary, although Khai's employment simply requires him to deal with computers. Huy's work will be focused on machine learning and deep learning, whereas Phuong Anh's game programming and Son and Hung's software programming will involve a lot of code and some design. Khai's employment entails a more analytical approach to data arrays. Everyone is on their own road, but they are all working toward the same goal, so the group continues to rally around one another. We are stepping into the future one step at a time by promoting each other's talents and limiting one other's weaknesses, thereby contributing to the overall success of the team.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h4>Topic</h4>
            <p>
              In this project, our group intends to create an e-commerce website
              that focuses on selling organic and fresh ingredients in Vietnam.
              These days, one of the most controversial problems in Vietnam is
              food safety and the rising prices of organic food for consumers.
              Demands for fresh and organic ingredients in Vietnam are always high
              and not surprisingly mostly from people with good average income.
              Profit is high and vendors can easily find out how much they will
              gain or lose in only a few short days. Moreover, in Hanoi, people
              can easily find an area with no organic food store within a
              2-kilometer radius. In other words, this is a potential field of
              business with high demands yet the competition is not too fierce.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we planned to do this project, there were different goals,
              outcomes and meaningful purposes that we expected when this project
              came into practice. Firstly, during this struggling time of
              pandemic, citizens’ demands on necessity have been increasing
              sharply, especially in regards to groceries and ingredients.
              Moreover, online shopping is becoming more and more familiar with
              Vietnamese people. As a result, our project aims to be one of the
              most reputable fresh, organic grocery and ingredients providers in
              Hanoi with our online platform very suitable with the pandemic
              situation in Hanoi these days. By choosing to use our services,
              users can minimize their social interaction. Also, our business
              offers users convenience - fast delivery would be applied to ensure
              the freshness and safety of food. Secondly, based on our experience
              as a long-time citizen of Hanoi, people often find it hard to ensure
              the safety of food and ingredients, and their choices are biased by
              famous brands such as Vinmart or BigC. However, they are not the
              original producers of those ingredients but rather the re-sellers.
              Our aim is to focus on the production, helping farmers to produce
              based on different standards, such as VFA (Vietnamese Food
              Association) or Vietgap, the ingredients that we will sell on our
              platform. Additionally, consuming fresh, organic food is one of many
              ways to improve life quality, and this is also one of our main
              missions: Our ecommerce website would enable more and more people to
              approach fresh and organic food, change their habit in ingredient
              selection: organic and fresh ingredients that are carefully
              authorized would be their priority instead of unsafe ingredients
              from local markets. Finally, a website and an app would be created
              as the platforms to sell our product. In this, we want to focus on
              the UI and UX of the website, make it user-friendly, easy to use and
              suitable for most people at every age to buy ingredients from us and
              most importantly, provide the consumers with an enjoyable shopping
              experience.
            </p>
  
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
              Hanoi is the capital city with nearly 10 million people, and one of
              the biggest business, culture, and education centers of Vietnam.
              Most citizens with high income live in the urban areas, or the
              downtown. Moreover, in recent years, the importance of food safety
              and ingredients in our life has been widely propagated on social
              media and other online newspapers, such as in protecting people’s
              health and the awareness of citizens has been increased
              significantly. As a result, organic and fresh food is a potential
              market for us to start our business. The variety of range and
              sources is an advantage in this field, where a number of farmers are
              able to produce quality ingredients, but safety authorisation is
              required. The potential to earn profit in this market is one of the
              factors that motivated us to start. Secondly, being able to help
              more people access organic and fresh ingredients is another
              motivation for us, so we can change consumers’ food shopping habits,
              improve their lifestyle with quality and fresh ingredients.
              Moreover, being one of the most quality food and ingredients
              providers in an area is one of the factors that would make us
              satisfied and be motivated to improve the quality of both
              ingredients and the e-commerce platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              IT trends these days are supporting us to develop and bring this
              project into practice, starting with the growing e-commerce share in
              Vietnam. According to cekindo, “Throughout 2020, online shopping
              increased penetration, and transaction volumes, resulting in a
              whopping 54% gain in e-commerce sales in Vietnam, which is predicted
              to surpass the contemporary trade share of sales in 2028”[1]. In
              other words, e-commerce is growing rapidly in recent years in
              Vietnam. Moreover, during this pandemic, people have to work from
              home, minimizing their social interactions with other people. As a
              result, this is an opportunity for e-commerce websites to develop
              their service due to the fact that demand on online shopping and
              delivery has boosted. Secondly, website developers in positions such
              as Front-end, Back-end or Full-stack are the most popular jobs right
              now in the IT industry in Vietnam. High demand for these positions
              is one of the opportunities for us to recruit and collaborate with
              quality web developers from positions that we have listed to achieve
              our goal: designing a user-friendly website to make it suitable for
              most people to utilize our service. Another IT trend that is
              remarkable in recent years is QR code. It is stated by Scanova Blog:
              “Covid-19 has even fueled Asia’s future in digital payment.
              According to McKinsey & Company, there is an 80/20 rise in digital
              payments. That means the digital user base has seen a 20% increase,
              where 80% has been registered during the peak of Covid-19. It is
              expected to remain for the long term even post-pandemic.”[2]. The
              use of QR code has been increasing worldwide with more and more
              users and purposes. In Vietnam, during the pandemic, QR code is
              compulsory for health declaration in public places - a convenient
              way. In other words, even older people who do not have any
              experience with smartphones can use QR code as required by the
              Government. We believe that this is a chance for us to apply QR code
              in our project, which is used to track the information of the
              ingredients that users buy easily, from production date to expired
              date, and most people can use QR code to check the quality of the
              product. Indeed, these IT trends would be advantages for us to apply
              different IT technologies and recruitment for this project. Our
              future employees would have the chance to catch up with the updated
              IT trends and learn how to work with other colleges with different
              professions, marketing, researching skills to find quality
              ingredient sources with the most reasonable price. This project is
              also a chance for us to display our researching skills as well as
              our coding skills by making a prototype website for the “F’Grocers”
              project.

            <h4>Landscape</h4>
            <p>
              These days, in the market, there are a number of companies working
              on organic and fresh food and ingredients, such as Soi Bien, Klever
              Fruit, Big green, Homefarm, etc. They have different advantages
              compared to each other and us. Take Klever Fruit for example, they
              have quality sources of fruit, not only from Vietnam, they also sell
              quality fruit from foreign countries, such as New Zealand’s cherry
              or Korean strawberry, whilst Soi Bien has a different range of
              products. Both of these companies have a long time in business, and
              they have different experience in this field. They are our main
              competitor of this project. However, differences in our project
              would be our advantages. Firstly, we intend to show our consumers
              the exact place of the ingredients that are produced, the
              information of that farm or factory with the authorisation both from
              us and the VFA (Vietnamese Food Authorisation) in order to prove our
              reputation for users to trust our providers. QR code would be used
              and users can easily see this information anytime. Secondly, we
              would conduct this project totally on an online platform. By doing
              that, our team would save a huge amount of money because we do not
              have to hire brick-and-mortar stores to sell our products. As a
              result, the price of our products will be more reasonable, becoming
              more competitive compared to our competitors, such as Soi Bien and
              Klever Fruit with different stores and departments in many regions
              across Vietnam. In our opinion, an affordable price is one step
              closer to helping consumers to be able to access fresh and organic
              food and ingredients. Another different feature that we would create
              in our project is a virtual store, where customers can control a
              character like in a game for shopping on our website. We believe
              that our differences would help us distinguish against our
              competitors and reach a more niche market with more purchasing power
              and ultimately expand our business.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <h4>1. Aims</h4>
            <p>
              In our project, one of the most important parts that we must work on
              is to find the aims and goals of the project. The project goals and
              aims like an arrow for our team, lead us to go on the right path and
              always figure out what we should do in this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is about providing organic and fresh ingredients, so
              one of our main goals for the business that we want to achieve is
              becoming one of the most reputable organic and fresh ingredients
              providers in Vietnam. Firstly, to be able to sell quality, fresh,
              organic and safe ingredients for users, one of our aims is making
              good relationships with our providers including farms, factories and
              other types of producers. Having good relationships with them is
              crucial due to the fact that there are a number of companies and
              corporations working in the organic and fresh food industry. One of
              the most important factors in the organic food business is the price
              that we bought from farmers and producers. Good relationship with
              them might help us with long-term cooperation with quality providers
              and many benefits that we would have, for example, the price would
              be lower for us to buy, providers always ensure that they provide us
              with the best quality ingredients of their production . As a result,
              our prices in the market would be more competitive compared to other
              competitors such as Soi Bien, Meat Deli,... Another aim is to expand
              our business: starting with the local area that we live in and later
              expanding it across the country. We want to start with Hanoi, where
              we live because it would be easier for us to start a business at a
              place that we understand most. After succeeding in Hanoi, we want to
              expand it to many regions across Vietnam, such as Ho Chi Minh City,
              Da Nang, Can Tho,... Another purpose of this business is to be able
              to compete with conglomerates in the industry and stay on top of
              organic and fresh food trends in Vietnam. In fact, we must expand
              our business by conducting research, surveys, and marketing to be
              able to compete with those companies and it is not an easy aim to
              achieve. However, on top of all that, the key factor in our success
              should be loyalty and being trusted by the consumers. Finally, our
              team aims to attract and hire quality employees for different work
              of the operation of this project, including marketing, researching
              the market to find providers, web developing, managers and other
              positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our business should have many ways for the users to access. By
              having virtually no brick-and-mortar store, our main medium to
              interact with the customers will be our website and our social media
              pages. The main target for us is that our website is simple to
              navigate and provides users with a friendly and interactive
              environment. When users look at some of the most popular e-commerce
              websites and apps in Vietnam like Shopee and Lazada, they can be
              irritated by the ugly, outdated UI design or many annoying
              advertisement pop-ups with over-the-place product windows. Overall,
              their website is way too clustered and busy. This is where our
              modern and minimalistic UI/UX design would attract a number of
              customers to allocate to our business. A visually appealing and
              aesthetically looking website is what we are aiming for and make us
              stand out from competitors. Among the organic food industry, it is
              hard to differentiate each other by business practices alone;
              however, by improving the customers experience and satisfaction at
              our sites, we would be what they gravitate to instead of other
              stores. In addition to that, a well designed website also helps us
              understand what our users want and increases the chance of turning
              them into loyal customers. The developers of the website also have
              to optimize files to prevent any delays and lag that the users may
              experience. Since all the transactions will happen on our websites,
              we need to strengthen our cyber-security and invest in a good
              InfoSec and Back-end team to prevent any breaches in our system.
              Letting hackers spread malwares in our system and expose customers'
              personal information can be extremely detrimental to our brand’s
              image and drive people away from using our platform.
            </p>
  
            <h4>2. Plans and Progress</h4>
            <h5>How it began</h5>
            <p>
              This project is one of the most interesting projects that we have
              ever thought about. However, the way we decide to conduct this
              project would be memorable for us. In October, our group was formed
              with 4 members at first: Hung, Son, Phuong Anh and me. At first, our
              idea is not about making a website to sell organic and fresh food.
              It was not until the beginning of November did we have the
              assignment details so we had to devise a plan for the Assignment 2’s
              project idea. Then the team met for the first time, with 4 initial
              members. We discussed different topics, technologies, etc that
              related to IT, not just to complete the assignment but also being
              able to find out what technologies are suitable for us to work on.
              In order to figure out which project should we do, we decide to
              focus on researching IT technologies in Assignment 2 with numerous
              different aspects: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing,
              Cyber-security, etc and IT jobs: DevOps, Tester, iOS developer, etc
              in order to find out what aspect of technology is most interesting
              for us to work on. Our process working on the technologies and jobs
              sections has helped us a lot in deciding to work on this project,
              when we have to research about the peculiarity, future job
              opportunity and our interest in each of those IT jobs and techs.
              After Khai joined our group 3 weeks before the deadline of
              Assignment 2 (19/11/2021), we have not decided yet and also we have
              finished IT tech and job research. Finally, one of the important
              factors that we have realized in IT is that our team members are not
              simply future programmers or developers. We would like to become
              businessmen not only in the IT field. As a result, we want to try
              our hand on a project that requires both IT and business for our
              project. As a result, our team decided to research problems that
              existed in Vietnam, and one of the most noticeable problems that
              attracted our attention is food safety. When Khai - the member who
              enter our group later than other members, suggest this idea, our
              group did not really interested in this idea, when organic and fresh
              food is not the new business with a number of reputable competitors
              in the market, such as Soi Bien, Klever Fruit, Big green,....After
              researching the problem, we did not believe in our own ability in
              business, so we decided to create a website as an affiliate
              marketing platform to sell different products from different organic
              food businesses. However, after we finished the brief about the
              project idea as an affiliate marketing platform, we realized that
              those companies had their own online platform to sell their
              products, and we think that they do not need us to market their
              products. As a result, we decided to discuss the project again and
              we decided to work on our own. Fortunately, after researching again
              about this problem and our experience in practice, we recognize that
              competition between companies in this market is not too fierce. The
              proof is that organic and fresh ingredients from the stores are
              still not Vietnamese priority when they buy ingredients. Instead,
              they would rather choose ingredients from the local market - which
              is a place with different ingredients problems. We wonder why the
              better choice of ingredients is not the best choice for consumers in
              Vietnam. After searching for more information, we have seen some
              problems of businesses in this field and we want to make this
              project practical. Finally, at week 8 of the course, we decided to
              work on this project and start simple steps.
            </p>
  
            <h5>How did we split work for each member?</h5>
            <p>
              We started assignment 3 at the beginning of Christmas break. That
              week was a break for us, thus we did not want to have pressure
              during the break, so the main work that we do this week is splitting
              work for each member instead of working at once. After discussing
              for an evening, everyone was informed about their own work for this
              assignment. Regarding Hung, he will write about each person's ideal
              job, compare and contrast in a paragraph, designing a graph to track
              group processes daily, and what have we done at the start date. The
              chart designed by Hung would be updated daily, if any work that each
              member has completed. Based on the chart, we can track our progress
              and review our work efficiency. Huy wrote about the overview of the
              project, including aims, motivation, landscape of the project and it
              would be updated and reviewed based on new ideas that we have while
              doing the assignment, testing the project. Son worked on the risks
              of our business, which cover almost all technical-related and
              business-related issues individually. Khai's work is to design the
              prototype for the project because this is one of the most important
              parts of this assignment. He needed 1 week to finish the prototype
              and he finally finished it after christmas break. After seeing the
              prototype, other members had more ideas to add and some improvements
              that our group might need for the business. For example, scopes and
              limits were easier to write after seeing the prototype because this
              part is mainly about features in the website that we are able to do.
              In the last week of the project, Hung wrote about the roles of the
              team members and group process and communication, to make an
              overview about how well our group collaborates with each other.
              However, although those work as individuals, other members’ feedback
              and corrections are required to ensure the best outcome for each
              part of the assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides individual work, there are many parts that require strong
              collaboration between team members. About the overview, after Huy
              finishes this part, other members will read and discuss with each
              other which aim is not reality, which should be our motivation for
              the project, based on other member’s feedback. Other members would
              based on this part to write about other aspects of this project.
              About plan and progress, this part is written by Huy and Khai,
              however, everyone needs to report about their own work that they
              have completed for Huy to check progress and efficiency of each
              member, besides Hung’s chart. Regarding the prototype, after Phuong
              Anh designed the UI and Khai hosted the website for the prototype on
              Github, each member would check, give feedback and comments about
              the prototype for further corrections and test on different devices
              to check if it could work well on different machines. One of the
              most interesting parts is Scope and limits. In this part, there are
              many features that we love to add into our website. Even though
              every member has their own idea, we need to discuss with each other
              about the practical and ability of each feature. Although Son and
              Huy take responsibility for this part, other members’ support helps
              them to complete this part easily. In order to avoid becoming scope
              freaks, every member should debate about the innovative feature that
              they tend to add into the website, including clear description,
              technology required, how does that help? By answering these
              questions, many unnecessary features have been removed in order to
              focus on what should be the advantages of this business. We believe
              that scopes and limit parts have been done well and we have decided
              features that we want to focus on in the future when we are able to
              do this project. Another important part that our group needs to work
              on seriously is the risk of this project. The risk of this business
              is what other members should think about, as a result, after Son
              writes the risk of business in his opinion, other members will give
              feedback and their own point of view about the business risk.
              Although we did not want to write too much about risks, we still
              want to write mostly every backside of this business for further
              calculation and consideration for different ideas that we tend to do
              in this project in the future. About the testing part, this part
              requires our team to take research carefully about each type of
              test, each characteristic, function of the web to figure out what we
              need to do to test, different parts require more than 1 person to
              do. However, at first, Huy wrote this part individually, however,
              due to some difficulties in his process, Son joined this part later.
              We have 7 tests required for the testing part, including usability,
              security, performance, functional testing is done by Huy and
              database, mobile application and A/B testing is written by Son.
              About tools and technologies, Khai and Phuong Anh take
              responsibility for this task and write about different required
              technologies. Khai anh Hung takes responsibility for writing the
              time frame, which is one of the most important parts in our project
              as a plan after we finish this assignment to start our project.
              Other members have given feedback to every part to have the best
              outcomes.
            </p>
  
            <h5>Work went on well and work did not</h5>
            <p>
              During our group process, we can find many works going on well and
              we can finish them soon and easily. However, there are many parts in
              the process that did not go on well and it tooks time and effort to
              deal with it and this part is inevitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the parts that we finished quickly is writing the overview.
              This is one of the most important parts in our assignment, where
              aims, landscapes and motivation need to be written and considered
              carefully for further effort in the future. We have discussed
              carefully before the assignment 3 and mostly about the aims and
              motivation, hence, when we read about the overview requirements, we
              knew that we could finish this part quickly and correctly as we have
              discussed before the assignment 3. Only one new feature is added in
              the landscape part later. This part has been finished in only 1 day,
              including other members’ feedback. Another part that went well is
              scope and limits. We can easily figure out simple and compulsory
              features in our website, such as searching product bar, product
              list, email and facebook plug-in log in,... This is not really hard
              to write about because every member in our group, especially Huy and
              Son who take responsibility to write this, have experience in
              different ecommerce websites and interaction with these features can
              be seen in most websites. Huy and Son have finished writing about
              compulsory features a.k.a in-scope functions in only 2 days. The
              next work that went well is making the prototype for the project, in
              many parts. This is only a prototype, meaning a demo for the project
              that we intend to work on in the future for first and foremost, our
              team to imagine how our project would work and for investors to see
              what we intend to do. As a result, although websites have many parts
              to work on: database, frontend, backend, we decide to work on what
              is viewable by users: UI (User interface) a.k.a frontend. HTML, CSS
              and Javascript are used by Khai to complete the prototype, including
              pictures, responsive parts such as researching bar, blogs, store,...
              that users can interact with. We do not design every function of the
              website, as a result, only some parts that are only viewable and not
              responsive, although we intend to make it a responsive part in the
              future. By doing research for tutorials and documents about
              designing the UI of a website, this is not a big problem and it can
              be finished in only 1 week by Khai. Our group did not think that
              Khai could finish the prototype quite so soon and all members in the
              team were satisfied with the prototype that Khai had done, although
              there were some struggles that Khai had to face and it would be
              mentioned later. Another part that works well is the risk for this
              project. Before starting assignment 3, we have thought of many risks
              for different projects that we tend to do for the project idea. Even
              though different ideas of different members in our team were
              interesting, if the risk is too high, we would think about other
              projects until we consider a project that has less risks and we have
              solutions for risks that we have thought of. As a result, when
              writing about the risk of the business, we do not have to brainstorm
              too much time and the risk is have finished in only 1 evening,
              including feedback and opinions of other members about the risks
              that we have to face. In the testing part, our team can understand
              different definitions and methods and put those research into
              practice and it did not take long time to write.
            </p>
  
            <h5>What we find hard in our progress</h5>
            <p>
              It is hard to admit that we have done all the parts easily without
              any difficulties. Firstly, when writing about scope and freaks, we
              did not understand about the requirement of this part and there are
              many parts we have misunderstood: We can not define what limit of
              the project is, whether it is about works or features that we should
              do, or it would be about some risks that we might have to face.
              Although in the assignment, there is one part that is only to write
              about risks, however, we can not distinguish between these parts, so
              we asked mr.Long for help. Fortunately, thanks to his support, we
              finally figured out that scopes and limits are mainly about
              technical features of our project. For instance, in our website,
              compulsory features of the website such as searching product bar,
              product listing, email log in,... are the features that are in our
              scope. About the limit a.k.a out of scope functions, we have to
              discuss a lot about this part, in order to decide which features
              should be put in this part, which we could do later or not to do.
              Fortunately, we have finished this part and are ready for our
              presentation. One of the most interesting features in our scope is
              the virtual store, although this is a risky feature in the website,
              we believe that it is worth trying for users to have a new shopping
              experience. Another part that we have problems with is designing the
              prototype - the demo for our website. In fact, all of our team
              members are freshmen in IT. As a result, when designing the UI of
              the website, errors, bugs are inevitable. Scale is the first problem
              that our team has to face. When Khai tested the prototype, he sent
              it to us to check whether the website was appealing from every
              monitor. Another part that has problems is responsive header. We can
              not finish the responsive header yet because of CSS conflicts, so we
              decided not to work on that part yet to save our time and effort.
            </p>
  
            <h5>How far did you develop the features of the project?</h5>
            <p>
              Despite our lack of experience and knowledge, we are proud that we
              have been able to create and develop some of the fundamental
              features of the front-end of the prototype website. It started with
              2 of the team members Khai and Phuong Anh finding inspiration for
              designing the UI of the project. We have stuck to our philosophy at
              the start that the website should be modern, minimalistic and
              aesthetically pleasing, in contrast to many other e-commerce sites
              in Vietnam. Khai has developed the home page, shopping section with
              placeholder products and other important parts such as the review
              page, contact information and our blog as well. In addition to that,
              he has utilized Javascript to create the search bar, login form with
              animations and pop-up design as well as the effects when you move
              the mouse on our products to display icons such as add the item to
              Wishlist or add to Shopping cart. Dead-ends you may have followed,
              decisions made, and changes that have been made to the project plan.
            </p>
  
            <h5>
              Dead-ends you may have followed, decisions made, and changes that
              have been made to the project plan.
            </h5>
            <p>
              As a team consisting of freshmen and having just started the first
              semester, we ran into quite a few limits in this project with little
              of our hands-on experience before. We were ambitious and wanted to
              be able to flesh out our ideas and suggestions for this project. At
              first, Khai wanted to manage his team wisely in order to have time
              to learn more about Javascript and ReactJs which is the most popular
              framework of Javascript to make the website more professional and
              powerful but he wasn't able to accomplish that. Also, we would love
              to learn about API to make the add to cart feature, create a
              database and perhaps learn PHP to build the server to make this more
              of a complete web project but it would take us months to accumulated
              all the needed knowledge so we have decide to put all it aside and
              focus more on the writing technical of this Assignment. But we are
              still happy that we didn't have to make any significant changes to
              our projects as the primary targets were still do-able and we are
              progressing gradually until the finish of the Assignment. Luckily,
              we didn’t run into dead-ends as after we realized and weighed the
              abilities of individual members, we decided to play it safe and put
              more focus on the writing section in order to reach the deadline
              on-time.
            </p>
  
            <h5>
              If I need to hand this project to another team, what would I want to
              know, if I were one of the people taking over?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Since this is quite a complex project, I would love to know all the
              fundamental components that the previous team has developed first,
              then I would expand their ideas and integrate my new features to
              make this project commercializable. Studying their source code,
              figuring out their way of naming conventions for HTML is essential
              in order for me to continue to work on the website. I have realized
              that the team has not built the back-end of the project so it would
              take me and my team months to set up a database, create the server
              for this e-commerce site and write numerous API to make the website
              interactive with users. I want to know what visions the team before
              us has encompassed for F’Grocers and see if it aligns with my views
              and how I should progress further. In addition to that, we need to
              learn about their business aspect and their relationship with
              providers, investors to improve and adapt with current trends on the
              market.
            </p>
  
            <h4>3. Roles</h4>
            <p>
              Because each member is in charge of the different sections for this
              project, our team does not divide specific roles. For the project to
              be successful, everyone must accomplish the allocated tasks. We
              distributed work for team members based on their knowledge and
              experience. However, when it comes to group operations, Huy is in
              charge of coming up with new ideas and functionalities for the
              website, Khai and Son will polish those ideas and make those
              functions work, and Hung and Phuong Anh will be in charge of the
              project's image and timing. Despite the fact that each member is in
              charge of various areas, everyone is doing equally vital work.
            </p>
  
            <h4>4. Scope and Limits</h4>
            <h5>In scope function</h5>
            <p>
              In our project, in our scope, a number of features would be added to
              our website. Our project is about making a website as the platform
              for e-commerce, as a result, it will include features that we called
              must-have.
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Finding product bar and related product suggestion</b>: This is an
              essential part of an ecommerce website. The bar search would help
              users to find products fast, easy and they would save time when they
              use our service and improve users experience. As a result, this
              feature is compulsory as well as other websites. In designing the UI
              of the website, we tend to put it on the top left corner, under
              F’Grocers' logo. In this bar, it is not only about searching for
              products, it also includes related product suggestions, based on
              keywords, the website will suggest related products. For example,
              when users search for fish, different products related to fish would
              appear, such as salmon, tuna,... would appear for users to know what
              we are selling and current products that related to what they have
              searched. More details about related product suggestions would be
              described later. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Blogs</b>: This is one of the most important features in our scope.
              Blog is the place where we tell the stories of our providers,
              including their personal stories, their production for the best
              quality products, their products on our website as well as
              documenting their day to day basis on the farm and perhaps providing
              some tips for new learners who want to get into agriculture. This
              also is a medium to prove their quality and reputation and display
              them for the customers. We believe that stories of our provider is
              important because their story appearing on our website is a sign of
              trust between us. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Related product suggestions</b>: This is also a must-have feature for
              an ecommerce website. There are several benefits for this feature,
              not only for developers but also customers. For customers, we
              believe that customers visiting our website not only see only one
              product, but also want to check other products, both similar or
              different types of products. Adding this feature in our website
              helps users to have more choice and approach more products when
              visiting our website and be able to choose the best ingredients
              depending on their demand. Moreover, this feature would help our
              business to increase the number of items per order of a customer,
              when related product suggestions work well and customers feel that
              our suggestions under their searched product can fulfill their
              interest and they would pick more, add to cart and are willing to
              purchase. Moreover, for developers, related product suggestions are
              the fastest way for our business to introduce new products for new
              customers, under the product that they are interested in and search
              for. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Customers’ feedback</b>: In this part, we tend to design 2 types of
              feedback for customers: answering our form and writing about their
              own experience. We will put the feedback a.k.a review on top of the
              website, when other users click on the “Review” button, the website
              will run into that page to show different products that other users’
              have bought from our website and their feedback about them and
              average point (out of 5) of a product. We believe that feedback that
              both customers and developers can view is a motivation for us to
              improve our service quality for further development. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Wishlist</b>: This function would help users to save products that
              they want to buy and pay for the total of those products at the same
              time. If they do not want to buy immediately, they can add them into
              their wishlist and pay later without finding those products again.
              This is a convenient function for users and it would improve the
              shopping experience of users. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Best seller list</b>: For customers, they would like to buy products
              that are bought by a number of people because the number of sales
              would be proof of quality and trustworthy. As a result, in order to
              improve sales efficiency, best sellers would be automatically added
              into this list, in order to manage ingredients we buy from
              providers: Increase importing best sellers products on our website
              and decrease other products to ensure stock of best seller products
              to increase profit. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Products on sale list</b>: Like best sellers, customers also like to
              purchase products at a discount. This list helps customers to easily
              find products that are in discount and purchase products that are in
              sale. This is also a list that we want to announce to customers
              about our sale campaign to attract more customers to buy our
              products. Every product on sale would be automatically updated here.
              --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>FAQs</b>: Besides chatbot which is responsible mostly for ordering
              products, FAQ is for problems or questions that can not be solved by
              chatbot. This is an important part because problems posed by
              customers needed to be coped at the right time to avoid negative
              feedback and support customers as much as we could. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Online payment</b>: This part is necessary, especially for an
              ecommerce platform. Different paying methods would be used, for
              instance Visa, Paypal or Mastercard. Users will click on one of the
              buttons on the right corner of the webpage to choose between
              different payment methods and then decide which one is the most
              convenient for them. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Email/Phone number subscription for update</b>: This is an optional
              part, where users can leave their information for us if they are
              interested in our products. Users will also write their information
              on the bar in the right corner of the website. This information will
              be used for further advertisement as well as keep contact with
              customers. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Points earned as a discount</b>: This is a type of discount for
              customers. Whenever our customers purchase ingredients from our
              website, they would earn points based on the prices of their
              receipt. If they want to earn points when purchasing on our website,
              they need to register to become a member and their personal
              information is required, including name, phone numbers, email or
              facebook,... They can use points for discounts in the future, when
              they use our service again. We believe that discounts that can be
              used later would stimulate users to come back to use our service
              again to use the discounts, besides special offers on special
              occasions. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Login Form</b>: Along with creating a brand new account for using on
              our website only, users can also use their Google or Facebook
              account (there will be more platforms) to sign in to our website. By
              implementing this feature, we enable users to have a more tailored
              experience throughout many online platforms that they are using with
              features like product suggestions based on their search and recent
              interests. --
            </p>
  
            <h5>Limits</h5>
            <p>
              In our development process, there are many limits that we have to
              list down here. These functions would help us in saving our time and
              money to develop other features in our scope.
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Paid subscription (using Paypal or Visa/Mastercard)</b>: By paying us
              a small amount of money (9.99$ per month), a user can get more out
              of our website, which is in the form of notifications on the
              upcoming changes. For instance, a subscribed user will get an email
              notifying them about the details of the next sale period or about
              the products that are coming to our online store soon. Additionally,
              those who pay for our monthly subscription will also be prioritized
              when it comes to testing new store features or buying
              nearly-out-of-stock products. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>International payment</b>: Paying for what you buy will not be a
              problem with our website as we have plans to implement many common
              payment methods, including PayPal or Visa/Mastercard. Moreover, our
              customers will also be able to pay with their favorite e-wallet such
              as Momo or Apple Pay, as well as using cash when receiving products
              from shippers. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Shipping management</b>: We will develop a feature (for Prime users
              only) to track their shipment. In short, this feature allows users
              to know exactly where the shipper carrying their buy is at any given
              point of time so they can do other more important business without
              worrying about missing the shipper. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Virtual store</b>: Online store would be an interesting feature of
              our website. User will have a new shopping experience, when they can
              control a character to move around a virtual shop into different
              areas that sell different type of ingredients, for example, when
              users control their character walk into vegetable areas, the virtual
              staff would ask them what they need to buy, through different
              interaction to help users to pick products and purchase. Users can
              freely move around the store to pick every product in stock and the
              system will make receipts for customers. Besides the traditional
              shopping experience on websites: searching products, picking and
              purchasing online in a traditional way, this new shopping experience
              would be an advantage for our website. Although this feature would
              be new and not really efficient when the website first comes out,
              improvements would be conducted to bring the best experience to our
              dear customers, especially youngsters in the near future. However,
              this feature would be developed after the business is stable and has
              profits to save cost in the first time. --
            </p>
            <p>
              -- <b>Chatbot</b>: This is the innovative feature in our website. We want
              to apply chatbots in our website because it has benefits for both
              users and developers. Firstly, for users, we believe that chatbot
              would improve users’ experience with many benefits for them: instant
              reply, automatic response, less human errors. In other words, this
              is an automatic system that would answer questions of customers
              instantly and 24/7 effectively, and it is reliable for customers to
              interact with chatbots for their needs. After answering and
              recording questions of customers, chatbot can also make receipts for
              the order of customers and ready for payment and customers can
              finish ordering without logging in to our website again to pick
              products. For the development team, chatbot is a useful tool to
              collect users’ information through interaction with chatbot, for
              example, a customer who is interested in a healthy diet. This
              information can be used for related product suggestions. We believe
              the potential of future chatbot and its innovation would help us to
              improve the efficiency of our business. However, in the short term
              chatbot can not be applied instantly when the website first
              launches. This feature would be added after our business becomes
              more stable. --

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
              In our project, besides creating the website, testing the website is one of the most important tasks to ensure that our website works well and has no errors as we expect. There are many factors of the ecommerce that we need to test with different works, methods and tools.
            </p>
            <h4>Functional testing</h4>
            
            <p>
              Functional testing is the first test to be conducted on our website. Functional testing is used to verify if the website works as the requirement and expectation of our group or not. In functional testing, there is much work that must be done to ensure that all functions in the website works well. Firstly, URL a.k.a Link testing is involved in functional testing. Our job in testing is to ensure that every link that is included in the website should work. Another field that we would like to test is input field testing. This field includes user login form, writing users’ information on our website.The information should be recorded wisely through user input. Cookies testing is another part in testing the website. Cookies are small pieces of information that store user sessions when they visit our website. Cookies help users to continue on the page that they previously accessed on our website, so it would be important to test this function. The final part that we want to test is end-to-end workflow testing. E2E testing is about testing the workflow of the website, from beginning to the end. This test aims to replicate real cases to be validated for integration and data integrity. Hardware communication, network connectivity, databases and other applications should be tested wisely.
            </p>

            <h4>Usability testing</h4>
            <p>Another important test is usability testing. Our project is an ecommerce website, so when they visit our website to buy our products, if the website is not convenient and users can not get on well with the website easily and quickly, we would lose our customer. Usability testing outcome will show User-friendliness, efficiency, errors and user satisfaction. Firstly, before starting the test, our aim in usability testing is a user-friendly website, easy to get used to and make sure that every process that customers use the website step by step, from visiting the website and finishing their shopping experience would be comfortable. For usability testing, after setting the aim for the website, we would like to test the website by hiring testing professionals or inviting a number of participants to use our website and we would have a chance to see in real life how users use our websites and their feelings about UI, friendliness,.... After setting plans and methods, we need to find participants, from professional to ordinary users. We believe that opinions and ideas from professionals and users would be helpful for us to improve the quality of our project. </p>

            <h4>Security testing
            </h4>
            <p>Security testing is another part that requires testing in our project. “There are many security risks from cyber attacks, such as password cracking, URL manipulation, SQL injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and other types of attacks.”, according to testbytes [4]. In order to prepare for security testing. We need to understand the security requirements for our website . Information in our websites should be engaged, analyzed, and researched in order to identify threats that we would have to face. For example,  we must take further research on XSS and SQL injection because it would affect the content appearing on our website. Based on requirements, our test would be planned carefully, inviting security professionals for more solutions for the threats. We admit that automatic testing is the most efficient testing method, as a result, different testing tools for different risks would be used based on our research. Security test cases must be ready before testing, for example, in online payment, how the website would work to secure the transaction of customers on our website. Test would be started after all the following steps. Efficiency, risks and threats should be written in a report in order to improve security in the future. The report should be as specific as possible. 
            </p>

            <h4>Performance testing 
            </h4>
            <p>Performance testing is another test required for the website. According to Guru99,  “Performance Testing is a software testing process used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability and resource usage of a software application under particular workload. The main purpose of performance testing is to identify and eliminate the performance bottlenecks in the software application.”.[5]  Before starting testing the website, we need to identify the testing environment, tools available and first. We need to do more research on the stress and workload that a commercial website would have to take, maximum number of users, time that would attract the most customers to visit our website. Based on our research in the future, testing plan would be setted, including goal: Minimize every problems related to performance to occured. By following this goal, our aim is not to make sure that the website run smoothly every time with many users, for example, our back end do not have to be like the back-end of Google, with billion of users, as a result, workload must be identified to save costs and time in testing and operating. Setting a testing environment, taking the test with different qualities in the plan and writing a report about the test are the last steps of testing.
            </p>

            <h4>Database testing
            </h4>
            <p>Database testing is another important step for testing. It is stated on Guru99 that “Database Testing is a type of software testing that checks the schema, tables, triggers, etc. of the Database under test. It also checks data integrity and consistency. It may involve creating complex queries to load/stress test the Database and check its responsiveness.” [6] Database testing is important in our project because validation of data and information that our website receives would be ensured. Data loss, aborted transactions on our website would be saved and avoid unauthorized access to the information thanks to database testing. This test is mainly about backend testing. In our system, data will travel back and forth from the UI to the back-end database and vice versa; therefore, there are some aspects to watch for, including checking whether the fields in the UI (or the front-end) forms are read consistently with the corresponding fields in the back-end database and checking whether whenever a certain actions performed at the front-end, a right corresponding action gets invoked at the back-end front.
            </p>

            <h4>Mobile application testing
            </h4>
            <p>One other testing field that we the founders need to do is mobile application testing. These days, mobility solutions have taken over the market; thus, people do not use PCs for everything they want to do on the Internet but rather they want their handheld devices to handle those tasks as efficiently. Hence the mobile solutions must be tested thoroughly. As a matter of fact, testing web apps on mobile devices is more challenging than that on PCs. There are several reasons for this:
            </p>
            <p>-- <b>Wide range of mobile devices:</b> different screen sizes and hardware configurations such as keypad or trackball. --
            </p>
            <p>-- <b>Various range of mobile devices brands:</b> Apple, SamSung, Xiaomi, Oppo, etc --
            </p>
            <p>-- <b>Different versions of mobile OS:</b> iOS 12.x, iOS 15.x, BB5.x, etc --
            </p>
            <p>-- <b>Different mobile network operators:</b> GSM or CDMA --
            </p>

            <h4>A/B Testing</h4>
            <p>The last method of testing we intend to use is the one that is called A/B Testing (also known as Split Testing or Bucket Testing), which involves comparing two versions of an application or a website to pick out the one that performs better. A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal [1]. In this method, the tester will have to take a webpage, modify it in order to create a second version of it and then direct half of the traffic to the original page and the other half to the modified version. Depending on the statistics gathered by monitoring the usage of both versions, the tester can determine whether the changes made have positive, neutral or negative effects on the behavior of users. The reason we decided to use this method is that A/B Testing allows us the founders to make careful changes to the website while still being able to collect data from the users. Besides, this method will enable us to optimize the website for desired outcomes and broaden the ability to make a more effective marketing campaign.

            <p>You will need to use a RMIT account in order to view the table of our timeframe:

            <h3>Risks</h3>
            <h4>Technical risks</h4>
            <p>
              It is very clear that every business must face certain risks and ours is not an exception. The first risk, which is also the most obvious one, is data privacy and online security in general. The reason this is very dangerous and can even sabotage the whole business is that hackers are becoming more sophisticated each day with new tricks up their sleeves, which means the chances for a company to get malwares or viruses are higher than ever if they do not know how to prevent such incidents. The damage of being hacked is extremely vital as it could cost the founders an arm and a leg and that has not included reputational damage, which would even be a lot more devastating. Consequences of hacking are the leakage of information, including customers’ name, address, their bank account and other information, while for developers, contents on our website would be changed, server might be crashed and our income might be gone. That leads us to another risk, which is platform downtime. Even big ecommerce sites such as Lazada or Tiki must schedule downtime to update or maintain their servers. Therefore, if we are not careful when setting up our business servers, we might have to shut down these for longer times or more frequently than intended, which will surely make a huge impact on our productivity in the long run. Additionally, too frequent downtime will also damage our reputation from the point of view of our partners (i.e providers) and customers. On top of that, we have to deal with numerous plug-ins and softwares to implement into our websites in order to make it function the way we intended. However, not all the plug-ins and softwares are created equal, so they can very well not be compatible with each other. One might get very excited when knowing what plug-ins can make what become possible on their sites, but if for some reasons it is incompatible with the platform or other apps on the systems, everything will suddenly refuse to work as they should be or in the worst scenario, nothing will work at all. Moreover, new applications are coming out at an alarming rate. Those apps may work but if there are no further updates, patches or support from the creators, our ecommerce store will be very vulnerable to new forms of cyber-attacks. Another risk that we might have to face is about user-friendliness. Although testing is conducted carefully, we can not ensure that our website would be easy for everyone to get used to easily, and this would be an obstacle preventing users from having a comfortable shopping experience. Last but not least, we have to optimize the website to prevent a long loading process which could make many customers dissatisfied. This issue has proven to be a long-term one on many other websites since they have tons of effects on a single web page. We aim to have many effects on our website so this issue is also a concern for us. Optimizing the website might be a difficult task, but failing to do so would prove devastating to our business.
            </p>

            <h4>Business risks 
            </h4>
            <p>With technical-related risks out of the way, let us discuss more on the side of business-related ones. It is of utmost necessity that every single business has enough funds to be launched or established, or in other words the founders must invest a large enough amount of money that could be either their own or from other sources like loaning friends or relatives. As a matter of fact, they (the founders) should devise a detailed financial plan showing income projections, how much cash is required to break even and the expected return for investors (and for themselves) in the first few years time frame. Failing to make a plan as such could mean the entrepreneurs risk bankruptcy and investors might get nothing in return from their investments. In addition, an entrepreneur must always be aware of their competitors. As of now, there are already a handful of big online shopping platforms such as Lazada or Tiki, which means a new such platform may struggle to compete with these “big guys”. Without any creative innovations or features for the website, our business could be an unsuccessful investment. In detail,  big online shopping platforms like Shopee or Lazada always have strategies in the sales plans and burning-money strategies on different occasions in a year such as selling products for 1k VND to attract numerous of users to pay on discounted products, however, our business can hardly have burning-money strategies on big sales like them. Reputation is another problem that we have to face when our business starts. As we mentioned, there are many reputable companies working on organic food such as Soi Bien, Klever fruit and other companies. In order to be reputable, our team needs to have different strategies about our business, including marketing, branding, market research and other business-related work. Moreover, after being reputable and trusted by users, when we expand our business, the quality of the ingredients that we sell need to be consistent, because we might not find enough providers as the demand of users increases. This problem leads to the last but not least risk, approaching ingredient producers. In Vietnam, it is hard for an ordinary farm to invest and start to produce higher quality ingredients, in other words, finding and approaching a good quality farm is not easy. Moreover, when we found and collaborated with reputable farms, we also need to have strategies to keep good relationships with them .If our business does not seem intriguing to the farmers, they may very well not believe in us and rather just sell their produce themselves. The same can be said for vendors and providers as they probably do not think that it is not worth their time and money to cooperate with us. In other words, not being careful when devising a plan to approach providers and we could end our business even before making it into existence.

            <h3>Group processes and Communications</h3>
            <p>
              Our group comprises five individuals, making it the largest in the course. We send messages and talk via Messenger or Discord on a regular basis to organize meetings, where and when they will take place, and to discuss projects and assignments. However, due to the deadly pandemic, we don't meet outside of school hours very often, but the time we have in class is insufficient for us to discuss what has to be done. So we still meet once a week in a coffee shop or in the school library to discuss project deadlines, assignments, dividing work for each person to do in the smallest amount of time, and brainstorming solutions to challenges we've met in the past. We work more smoothly than planned since everyone is aware of the importance of meeting deadlines. And because everyone is incredibly professional and responsible, we all work well together, literally "teamwork." However, if a member is not responsible, ignores the group's work, or is uninterested in the project and assignment, we will remind that person or even make a report to the teachers and lecturers to take appropriate action.

            <h2>Huy Doan</h2>
            <p>
              The last few months working together was a memorable time for me
              when I first studied at RMIT university. In the project, together
              with Son and Hung, most writing parts have been done by us. However,
              for me, writing about the aim, scope and limits have some problems
              for me because the aim, the prototype and the business model have
              changed and different members have different ideas about this part.
              As a result, I have to ask every member in scopes and limits
              function if they have any great ideas about new features that we are
              able to work on in the future. Our ideas have changed at different
              times, so the aim changes frequently until we find the most suitable
              idea. I think the prototype and the website of our group went well
              because they could finish that part quickly: Khai finished the UI of
              the website in 1 week, and that is what we need for the
              presentation, while Phuong Anh can update our assignment on our
              website anytime. There are many things that surprise me in the
              process. Firstly, I was really surprised about the studying process
              and requirements at RMIT: Most ideas that we follow require
              significant research, both on technical and market, so the process
              of my group and myself have been slow because I have not got used to
              this study method. Secondly, on our presentation day, I have seen
              other groups have their own working product to present, and that was
              interesting and motivated me to learn more to be able to have
              hands-on experience on different IT projects as soon as possible.
              Although the group process is slowed down sometimes, I think that we
              still have good communications and relations with other members of
              the team who are always willing to support other members and give
              necessary feedback to improve group work. I am happy that our group
              has worked on well and finished this assignment with each other
              despite conflicts and different points of view we have in the
              process or slow down. Finally, besides IT-related skills, I have
              learned how to research efficiently, manage my time and motivate
              my-self for more self-study in the future to have more hands-on
              experience in IT.

            <h2>Tran Anh Son</h2>
            <p>
              The last several months working with the team has been a helpful and
              enjoyable experience for me as I have discovered more about my own
              abilities to work well in a team and I also gain more knowledge on
              some other aspects of the Information Technology world. Suffice to
              say, our work went rather smoothly from start to finish. We were
              never restricted to anyone’s idea and could express our ideas freely
              and all other members respect them. Moreover, the communication part
              of our team is very effective and smooth as we know each other quite
              well. I consider Huy as the team leader because he is the one who
              assigned what member to do what part or section of the whole
              project. He also is responsible for some writing sections, and he
              did a pretty good job albeit with some errors here and there. Phuong
              Anh and Khai are the ones who designed and built our team website as
              well as the project website due to the fact that they possess
              knowledge on HTML and CSS. Hung and I are responsible for writing
              the report for this Assignment. Besides, Hung also made the
              Gantt-Chart and I also had to edit and fix all the errors in the
              report. Truth be told, correcting grammar errors and re-formatting
              the whole report is a tedious job, but as the other members also had
              their duties so I did not complain. One thing that I found to be
              very amazed during the time working with the team was that Phuong
              Anh could design such a neat and good-looking website for the
              project, which meant she must have put a lot of effort into doing
              that. However, if I could turn back time, I would have tried to make
              a fully functional website for the F’Grocers project. In conclusion,
              we had such good teamwork and the workflow was so smooth that I did
              not feel any pressure working with all the other members.

            <h2>Tran Duy Hung</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Hung, and I'm a member of the ROC team that, along with
              Phuong Anh, was in charge of the group's graphics and project. In
              addition, I provide minor items such as group communication, roles,
              and timeliness; a market research portion in the presentation; and
              assistance with powerpoint slide creation. Personally, I believe
              that this project will take a long time to complete, from conception
              to implementation. When we first started working on Assignment 2, we
              couldn't figure out what we were going to do. Our team had intended
              to build a game at first, however producing a game in just one to
              two months is nearly impossible at the present. As a result, we
              considered other common difficulties that can be remedied with the
              help of information technology. The idea for a website selling
              "wonderful, nutritious, affordable" food arose from there. This will
              be a place where customers can get hygienic, good-quality meals at a
              cheap price, which is ideal for times of epidemics and regular
              isolation like the ones we're experiencing now. The process of
              creating and supplying information about the project is very simple
              and straightforward, but constructing such a system necessitates a
              number of external factors that cannot be solved by IT, such as
              product supply, input, and output,... And developing a website is
              not easy when everything is simply at the conceptual level; in order
              to make them work, more knowledge is required. I was astonished that
              our team was able to work together because we all have different
              personalities and I didn't think it was feasible. We learned how to
              adapt to the environment as well as the way individuals around us
              work as a result of this endeavor. Hopefully, we, the ROC team, will
              be able to make this project a huge success in the future, allowing
              us to address the present pandemic's food concerns.

            <p>
              The time we cooperated to complete Assignment 3 has come to an end, as well as our group has been working for nearly 2 months. The diligence of 5 members in the group with different positions have collaborated and produced such a unique project that I’m extremely amazed and expected. In this project, most of the writing was done by Huy, Son and Hung while Khai and I took the responsibility for creating the project website as well as the group website. During the process, although there were still some disagreements between members, we were still able to come to an agreement at the end of the conversation as we have known each other earlier and understood the differences of working process and characteristics. All members have performed professionally and unitedly, which is the factor that I appreciate the most after cooperation. For more in-depth mention, the current project website would not exist if there was not any creative support of the idea from Khai and Huy. F’Grocers is accurately a high practicality project as well as being able to anticipate the future of agriculture. By its uses, this project can be a solution solving many dilemmas for farmers in personal income, crop, food supply needs and more. Crucially, Khai and Huy are the key members who fruitfully lead the team to today’s success. Besides, Hung and Son are the ones who took the most time-consuming parts in the project: while Son spent his time looking after the decoration for the PDF file, Hung undertook the role of making Gantt-Chart. Both of them are all effective and initiative in updating the information regularly to ensure the maintenance of the work process for the whole team. Looking back my performance and based on my Github log, although there were still some undesirable things happened during making the group website, I feel satisfied of everything I have contributed to the team and I appreciate to Khai, who spent time to help and support me on debugging some errors existing on the website in order to make everything look perfectly. Each member was assigned a different job equally and overall, everyone was all responsible and completed it very well. After this project, I believe everyone will gain a lot of useful experiences in order to improve ourselves to be a better version and have more incredible performances in other projects in the future.

            <p>
              The last 2 months working with the group has been an enjoyable and
              helpful experience as I learn more about my abilities to work as a
              part of a team and my maturity as we progress in the project
              building process. We hit it off quite well and were able to express
              our suggestions and ideas freely. During the process, our team has
              no problem in communication as we have formed a friendship earlier
              in the course. All 5 of us were working with a professional manner,
              each teammate approached the assignment with dedication and
              responsibility. Although there was still a bit of disagreement
              between us, some differences in our point of view made us move quite
              slow in some sections of the assignment as sometimes we would be
              stuck on a subject for a few days without making any progress. But
              my team’s member Phuong Anh surprised me when she decided to learn
              front-end web development and stepped up to be responsible for our
              website to lift a part of my workload as I would try to build a
              small prototype for our project and she finished it way above me and
              my teammates’s expectation. But then again, working as a team is
              hard, for a lot of time, things are not going to progress in your
              preferred direction. I have learnt how to manage time for us to be
              able to finish the assignment before deadlines as I was ambitious
              and trying to build a project that was beyond our abilities and
              experience for the time being and if I proceed to chase that goal,
              we would not have a cohesive presentation and a project showcase.
              Based on my Github log, I can say that my performance has been
              acceptable. Aside from creating the demo website, I also assisted
              Phuong Anh with a little help with web development for our team
              website. I am hoping to expand my knowledge and abilities to provide
              better insight and be able to fully fleshed out my ideas in the
              upcoming projects.
